For a Kaggle dataset problem, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and trends within the dataset. 
Building upon these insights, I developed regression and random forest models to predict marketing values, allowing for data-driven forecasting and 
optimization of marketing strategies. This project honed my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and the application of machine learning algorithms 
to solve real-world business problems. It provided me with valuable experience in using predictive analytics to guide decision-making processes in marketing.
