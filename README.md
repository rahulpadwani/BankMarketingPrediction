# Bank Marketing Prediction ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a financial institution's past marketing campaign data to identify key patterns and optimize future strategies. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models (Random Forest & Regression), the project predicts the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit, enabling data-driven decision-making.

### Key Features

Data Preprocessing â€“ Handled missing values, outliers, and feature encoding for improved model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized key trends using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

Machine Learning Models â€“ Implemented Random Forest & Regression for predictive modeling.

Model Evaluation â€“ Assessed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance insights.

### Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
